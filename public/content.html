      <h3>
        Instead of fearing AI or viewing it as a threat, individuals should view
        it as a tool
      </h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way humans
        approach creativity and career development. While some individuals may
        fear that AI will take over their jobs or stifle their creativity, the
        reality is quite different. In fact, AI can enhance and augment human
        creativity in ways that were previously impossible, enabling individuals
        to achieve more in their careers than ever before.
